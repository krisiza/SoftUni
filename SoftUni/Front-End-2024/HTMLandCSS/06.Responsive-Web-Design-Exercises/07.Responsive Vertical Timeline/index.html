                    <p>Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document called “Information Management: A Proposal”.

                        <li><b>URI</b>: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
                        <li><b>HTTP</b>: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.</li>
